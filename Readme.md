# Native Mahou 
Native Mahou(ネイティブ魔法) - a faster layout switcher(just like [Mahou](https://github.com/BladeMight/Mahou)) written in **C**, it contains even more *magic*.

# Q/A

- Q1: Why **C** since **C#** version already exists?

- Q2: Why not **C++**?

- A(1+2): Because **C** IS faster and smaller. Thats all.

- Q3: Why **Makefile** instead of **vcxproj**?

- A3: Because **MinGW** with **Notepad++** IS faster and **smaller** than **Visual Studio**. And it is **very** comfortable for me to use it.

- Q4: When all functions from Mahou will be implemented?

- A4: Who knows?
